    "The pipelines make use of a number of standard bioinformatics tools. All of these must be installed and available on the `$PATH` for the pipeline to work correctly. All of the pipeline scripts check that the required programs are available before executing. If any required programs cannot be found, the script prints an error message about the missing program and does not continue. The versions used during development and testing are specified below. For most of the tools, any recent version should be sufficient. If problems arise, though, please use the version indicated below\n",

    "For OSX, a custom installation of numpy linking against the OpenBLAS library is required. We do not officially support this, but [example documentation](http://dedupe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/OSX-Install-Notes.html) is available elsewhere on the web.\n",
